### functionality 


### other

* Separate clientside JS/coffee source directory. I feel like I am being insulting to my frontend code puting it in public.
* Define some unit tests, get grunt.js to run them
* Lint and minify my JS (I have unminified JS in the external js folder at the moment) - another grunt.js task
* Look at CoffeeScript compiled source - does this need to be minified?
* (more as I think of / or remember them)
